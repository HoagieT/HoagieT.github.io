Hi! I’m Hogan, an MBA candidate at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/mba/). I was an economist by training with a background in applied mathematics, but I discovered my ehthusiasm in investment research and market forecasting since I started my career. My research and publication are  grounded in the idea that the financial market dynamics are inherently economic activities, which are directed, operated, and maintained (or not) in certain ways and not others, by people in and between institutions. Thus it is worthwhile to spend a significant amount of my life working on forecasting techniques.

## My work and research
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to investigate the relationships among economic indicators as well as asset prices. I had a particular focus on forecasting cash flow of equity tranches of consumer loan-backed securities, and forecasting China's macroeconomic trends and interest rate movements. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history
I received my M.A. in Applied Economics from the [Georgetown University](https://econ.georgetown.edu/academics/masters-programs-in-economics/masters-in-applied-economics/), my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, and my B.A. in Economics form the [National School of Development](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University. For just under four years after graduate school, I was at the [CITIC Securities](http://www.cs.ecitic.com/newsite/en/CorporateInformation/aboutciticsecurities/201710/t20171016_61176.html), the top 1 investment bank in China, as an investment analyst. At CITICS, I was first an alternative credit analyst, then became a rates strategist and led several advanced research projects, including the  yield curve forecasting, inflation alerting system, statistical arbitrage trating, etc.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
