Hi! I’m Hogan, an MBA candidate at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/mba/). I was an economist by training with a background in applied mathematics, but I discovered my ehthusiasm in investment research and market forecasting since I started my career. My research and publication are  grounded in the idea that the financial market dynamics are inherently economic activities, which are directed, operated, and maintained (or not) in certain patterns, by people in and between institutions. Economic activities are like physics in that they are both predicatable as long as we have access to the relevant data. Therefore, I spent a significant amount of my career working on forecasting techniques.

## My work and research
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to investigate the relationships among economic indicators as well as asset prices. I had a particular focus on equity tranches of consumer loan-backed securities, China's macroeconomy, and interest rate movements. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history
I received my M.A. in Applied Economics from the [Georgetown University](https://econ.georgetown.edu/academics/masters-programs-in-economics/masters-in-applied-economics/), my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, and my B.A. in Economics form the [National School of Development](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University. For just under four years after graduate school, I was at the [CITIC Securities](http://www.cs.ecitic.com/newsite/en/CorporateInformation/aboutciticsecurities/201710/t20171016_61176.html), CHina's top one investment bank, as an investment analyst. At CITICS, I was first an alternative credit analyst, then became a rates strategist and led several advanced research projects, including the  yield curve forecasting, inflation alerting system, statistical arbitrage trating, etc. I left my job in Sep 2020 and enrolled London Business School to pursue a MBA degree so that I can strengthen my understanding of business and explore opportunities in the international financial industry.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like economics, mathematics, business, and data science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spent a lot of my time in the fields of economic empirical research and financial forecasting. Methodologically, while I am trained as an economist and data scientist, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
