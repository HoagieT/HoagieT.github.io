Hi! I’m Hogan, an MBA candidate at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/mba/). I was an economist by training with a background in applied mathematics, but I discovered my ehthusiasm in investment research and market forecasting since I started my career. My research and publication are  grounded in the idea that the financial market dynamics are inherently economic activities, which are directed, operated, and maintained (or not) in certain patterns, by people in and between institutions. Economic activities are like physics in that they are both predicatable as long as we have access to the relevant data. Therefore, I spent a significant amount of my career working on forecasting techniques.

## My work and research
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to investigate the relationships among economic indicators as well as asset prices. I had a particular focus on equity tranches of consumer loan-backed securities, China's macroeconomy, and interest rate movements. Most of my previous work has focused on investing in equity tranche of consumer loan-backed securities, where I developed the first analytical algorithm for this asset class in China. I’ve also invested in project finance debt, mostly in infrastructure and real estate industries. I also studied China's macroeconomic chronology and developed forecasting methods to guide fixed income investment. I  often explore the intersection of these topics intersect with and are embedded in statistical models.

## My background and history
I received my M.A. in Applied Economics from the [Georgetown University](https://econ.georgetown.edu/academics/masters-programs-in-economics/masters-in-applied-economics/), my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, and my B.A. in Economics form the [National School of Development](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University. For just under four years after graduate school, I was at the [CITIC Securities](http://www.cs.ecitic.com/newsite/en/CorporateInformation/aboutciticsecurities/201710/t20171016_61176.html), China's top one investment bank, as an investment analyst. At CITICS, I was first an alternative credit analyst, then became a rates strategist and led several advanced research projects, including the  yield curve forecasting, inflation alerting system, statistical arbitrage trating, etc. I left my job in Sep 2020 and enrolled London Business School to pursue a MBA degree so that I can strengthen my understanding of business and explore opportunities in the international financial industry.

## My career interest
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like economics, mathematics, business, and data science. In terms of academic specialties, I spent a lot of my time in the fields of economic empirical research and financial forecasting. Methodologically, while I am trained as an economist and data scientist, I also rely on  qualitative methods to support fundamental research. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches in investment analysis. I am actively looking for internships and full time opportunities in investment research, ideally combining my most recently acquired business knowledge and my quantitative expertise.
