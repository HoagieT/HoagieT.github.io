One of my objectives of going to business school is to expand my analytical skills to include equity research, as I wish to explore the significant opportunities for learning and growth that the stock market offers. I recently represented the London Business School at the Chicago Booth Investment Competition (CBIC) and finished in the top four. This investment recommendation report was writen based on my stock pitch at the CBIC.
