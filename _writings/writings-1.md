Before I went to London and enrolled London Business School, I wrote this book as memoir of the first chapter of my career. I hope to use this book to pay tribute to Joseph Ellis, an ex-Goldman analyst. His book *Ahead of the Curve* greatly inspired my research ideas and laid the foundation for my research methodology. My book uses the same method to map out Chinaâ€™s macroeconomic logy and provided a viable forecasting framework to guide fixed income investment.
